# bk-tree 
Both header and implementation file of a complete bk tree implemented with C++11

There are 2 header files , one for the nodes and another one for the tree and 2 .cpp files from each header.

The implementation is pretty straightforward, it's easy to understand, since I wasn't able to find one bk-tree implementation to use in my cryptography class I made this one myself, if there are other people like me who needs it
