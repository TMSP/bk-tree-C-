# bk-tree 
Both header and implementation file of a complete bk tree implemented with C++11

There are 2 header files , one for the nodes and another one for the tree and 2 .cpp files from each header.

The implementation is pretty straightforward, it's easy to understand, since I wasn't able to find one bk-tree implementation to use in my cryptography class I made this one myself, if there are other people like me who needs it 
I'm giving my source files, just please maintain the free license and my name as the author.
